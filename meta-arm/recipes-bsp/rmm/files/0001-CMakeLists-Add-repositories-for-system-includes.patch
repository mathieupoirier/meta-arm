Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists: Add repositories for system includes

Yocto's default aarch64 toolchain, i.e aarch64-poky-linux-, doesn't
include assert.h and stderr.h by default, leading to a compilation error
for files that need them.  As such add the path of the base sysroot
directory to the list of directories to be included when compiling.
